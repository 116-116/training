This week I think I did nothing but reviewed the knowledge about Teacher Qualification Certificate. Although the change of timetable has break down my plans, but I sign up for the certificate cuz i want the 50% off of tickets that u have 2 buy 2 enter some scenic spot so it's not a problem. Furthermore, I had to take part in a Software Testing Contest hold by mooctest.net sence I'm major in Software Engineering and our teacher asked all students must sign up for that contest. After all, I have finally entered next tier and may get a good result.

I have got some interest in develop a bot under some social application like QQ, so I look up for some articles about develop through python and that might be not so hard. If all gose will, we maybe can spot a new bot at our chat group before next week. After that, web crawer will be a good skill to acquire.

I plan to take an IELTS test at the end of this year or next year. To learn more about the test and tricks to answer questions, I think courses will be much more important and they should not be absent. As the result, I may have no more time to learn things in lab, that's quite a regret as I'm willing to learn much more algorithms to make more advantages in the future.
